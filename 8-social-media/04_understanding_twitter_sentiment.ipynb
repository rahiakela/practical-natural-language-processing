        "When it comes to NLP and social media, one of the most popular applications has to be sentiment analysis. For businesses and brands across the globe, it’s crucial to listen to what people are saying about them and their products and services. It’s even more important to know whether people’s opinion is positive or negative and if this sentiment polarity is changing over time. \n",

Then combine the polarity and subjectivity numbers to arrive at a single value for the whole sentence. We leave it to the reader to get into the finer details. This simple sentiment classifier might not work well, primarily because of the tokenizer used by TextBlob. Our data comes from social media, so it will most likely not follow formal English. Thus, after tokenization, many of the tokens may not be standard words found in the English dictionary, so we won’t have the polarity and subjectivity for all such tokens.\n",

# Text Classification

## 🔖 Outline

Text classification is the task of assigning one or more categories to a given piece of text from a larger set of possible categories.

Text classification is a special instance of the
classification problem, where the input data point(s) is text and the goal is to categorize
the piece of text into one or more buckets (called a class) from a set of predefined
buckets (classes). The “text” can be of arbitrary length: a character, a word, a
sentence, a paragraph, or a full document.

Any supervised classification approach, including text classification, can be further
distinguished into three types based on the number of categories involved: binary,
multiclass, and multilabel classification. If the number of classes is two, it’s called
binary classification. If the number of classes is more than two, it’s referred to as multiclass
classification.

Thus, classifying an email as spam or not-spam is an example of
binary classification setting. Classifying the sentiment of a customer review as negative,
neutral, or positive is an example of multiclass classification. In both binary and
multiclass settings, each document belongs to exactly one class from C, where C is the
set of all possible classes. In multilabel classification, a document can have one or
more labels/classes attached to it.

Text classification is sometimes also referred to as topic classification, text categorization,
or document categorization. For the rest of this book, we’ll stick to the term “text
classification.” Note that topic classification is different from topic detection, which
refers to the problem of uncovering or extracting “topics” from texts.

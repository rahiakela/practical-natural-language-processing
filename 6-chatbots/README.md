# Chatbots

## üîñ Outline

Chatbots are interactive systems that allow users to interact in natural language. They
generally interact via text but can also use speech interfaces.

Platforms like Facebook Messenger, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa are some examples of
chatbots.

The introduction of chatbots into society has brought us to the beginning of a new
era in technology: the era of the conversational interface. It‚Äôs an interface that soon
won‚Äôt require a screen or a mouse to use. There will be no need to click or swipe; just
the use of voice will be enough.

In recent years, chatbots have become more feasible and useful, both due to the ubiquity
of smartphones and recent advances in ML and DL. In addition to APIs to create
chatbots on popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, we now have various
platforms to create the AI and logic behind the chatbots.


## üóíÔ∏è Notebooks

Set of notebooks associated with the chapter. 

1. **[Intent Detection using CNN, RNN](https://github.com/rahiakela/practical-natural-language-processing/tree/master/6-chatbots/1_intent_detection_using_cnn_rnn.ipynb)**: Here we demonstrate various CNN and RNN models for the task on Intent Detection on the ATIS dataset.

2. **[Intent Detection using BERT](https://github.com/rahiakela/practical-natural-language-processing/tree/master/6-chatbots/02_BERT_ATIS.ipynb)**: Here we demonstrate how to use pytorch pre-trained BERT to classify the intent in the ATIS dataset. 

3. **[Intent Detection using BERT(Binary)](https://github.com/rahiakela/practical-natural-language-processing/tree/master/6-chatbots/03_BERT_ATIS_Binary.ipynb)**: Here we reduce the intent classification task on the ATIS dataset into a binary classification task and then use pytorch pre-trained BERT to classify the intents.

4. **[Slot Filling using CRFs](https://github.com/rahiakela/practical-natural-language-processing/tree/master/6-chatbots/04_CRF_SNIPS_slots.ipynb)**: Here we demonstrate using CRFs to perform the task of Slot filling on the SNIPS dataset.

5. **[Slot Filling using BERT](https://github.com/rahiakela/practical-natural-language-processing/tree/master/6-chatbots/05_BERT_SNIPS.ipynb)**: Here we demonstrate using pytorch pre-trained BERT for the task of slot filling on the SNIPS dataset using the HuggingFace Transformers library.

6. **[Simple Chatbot using Chatfuel](https://github.com/rahiakela/practical-natural-language-processing/tree/master/6-chatbots/06_chatfuelbot.ipynb)**: Here we demonstrate how to build a simple chatbot which does not have "intelligence" to order pizzas using chatfuel.

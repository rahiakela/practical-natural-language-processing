        "A simple approach to building an NER system is to maintain a large collection of person/ organization/location names that are the most relevant to our company (e.g., names of all clients, cities in their addresses, etc.); this is typically referred to as a gazetteer. To check whether a given word is a named entity or not, just do a lookup in the gazetteer. If a large number of entities present in our data are covered by a gazetteer, then it’s a great way to start, especially when we don’t have an existing NER system available.\r\n",

        "Despite the fact that state-of-the-art NER is highly accurate (with F1 scores over 90% using standard evaluation frameworks for NER in NLP research), there are several issues to keep in mind when using NER in our own software applications. Here are a couple caveats based on our own experience with developing NER systems:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "- NER is very sensitive to the format of its input. It’s more accurate with wellformatted plain text than with, say, a PDF document from which plain text needs to be extracted first. While it’s possible to build custom NER systems for specific domains or for data like tweets, the challenge with PDFs comes from the failure to be 100% accurate in extracting text from them while preserving the structure. it illustrates some of the challenges with PDF-to-text extraction. Why do we need to be so accurate in properly extracting the structure from PDFs, though? In PDFs, partial sentences, headings, and formatting are common, and they can all mess up NER accuracy. There’s no single solution for this. One approach is to do custom post-processing of PDFs to extract blobs of text, then run NER on the blobs.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "- NER is also very sensitive to the accuracy of the prior steps in its processing pipeline: sentence splitting, tokenization, and POS tagging.To understand how improper sentence splitting can result in poor NER results and looking at the output from spaCy.So, some amount of pre-processing may be necessary before passing a piece of text into an NER model to extract entities."

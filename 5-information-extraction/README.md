# Information Extraction

## üîñ Outline

Information extraction (IE) refers to the NLP task of extracting relevant information from text documents.
An example of IE put to use in real-world applications are the short blurbs we see to the right when we search for a popular figure‚Äôs name on Google.
IE is a term that‚Äôs used to refer to a range of different tasks of varying complexity. The
overarching goal of IE is to extract ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù from text, and each of these tasks provides different information to do that.

Identifying that the article is about ‚Äúbuyback‚Äù or ‚Äústock price‚Äù relates to the IE task of
keyword or keyphrase extraction (KPE). Identifying Apple as an organization and Luca
Maestri as a person comes under the IE task of named entity recognition (NER). Recognizing
that Apple is not a fruit, but a company, and that it refers to Apple, Inc. and
not some other company with the word ‚Äúapple‚Äù in its name is the IE task of named
entity disambiguation and linking. Extracting the information that Luca Maestri is the
finance chief of Apple refers to the IE task of relation extraction.
